Hi, I am Manon Reusens, I recently graduated as a PhD student at the KU Leuven supervised by Professor [Bart Baesens](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IC7ghFwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and co-supervised by Professor [Seppe vanden Broucke](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uIfUaMMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and Professor [Wouter Verbeke](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ckyal8gAAAAJ&hl=en). In September, I start a postdoc with Professor [David Martens]() and Professor [Toon Calders]() as research manager of the [Antwerp Center for Responsible AI (ACRAI)]().

I am an interdisciplinary researcher specializing in Responsible AI, with a particular focus on bias and fairness in Natural Language Processing. My work bridges three perspectives: (1) technical, through deep expertise in NLP; (2) societal, by examining the human impact of AI systems; and (3) applied, drawing on my background in business engineering to translate insights into actionable guidelines for organizations.

ðŸŽµ I am also very passionate about music.  I have been playing the cello for 20 years, love to sing  in different bands, and also play the piano .
