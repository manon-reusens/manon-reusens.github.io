Hi, I am Manon Reusens, I am the research manager of the [Antwerp Center on Responsible AI (ACRAI)](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/research-groups/antwerp-center-responsible-ai/) under the guidance of Professor [David Martens](https://scholar.google.be/citations?user=gbce1doAAAAJ&hl=nl&oi=ao) and Professor [Toon Calders](https://scholar.google.be/citations?hl=nl&user=CcqxbMkAAAAJ). Moreover, I am Guest Lecturer at the KU Leuven teaching [Principles of Database Management](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/e/D0I62AE), a 6 ECTS course both for bachelor and master students.

I am an interdisciplinary researcher specializing in Responsible AI, with a particular focus on bias and fairness in Natural Language Processing. My work bridges three perspectives: (1) technical, through deep expertise in NLP; (2) societal, by examining the human impact of AI systems; and (3) applied, drawing on my background in business engineering to translate insights into actionable guidelines for organizations.

🎵 I am also very passionate about music.  I have been playing the cello for 20 years, love to sing in our band [Tomate Cravate](https://www.instagram.com/tomatecravate/), and also play the piano.
