Abstract:\\
Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse applications, yet their success and human-like interactions have fueled increasing concerns about anthropomorphization. This phenomenon presents both opportunities and challenges for organizations, from enhanced operational efficiency and personalization to concerns about privacy, bias, and corporate responsibility. This viewpoint article offers a cross-disciplinary synthesis of insights from Computer Science, Business, Psychology, and Law to develop practical, actionable guidelines for responsible LLM deployment. Rather than following a traditional empirical or theoretical framework, this article builds its contribution on critical interdisciplinary discussion and synthesis. This approach serves as the foundation for the proposed 6P Guidelines, which balance ethical considerations with business value and help organizations navigate the complex challenges posed by LLMs. The guidelines address crucial aspects including accountability, tool selection, critical thinking, privacy protection, human-centric design, and expectation management. This comprehensive approach helps organizations navigate the technical, ethical, and legal challenges of LLM deployment while maximizing their transformative potential. Our analysis highlights how proper implementation of these principles can help organizations harness LLM capabilities while maintaining ethical standards and building sustainable stakeholder trust.
